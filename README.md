Vehicle Telemetry System in Unity<br>
<br>
This project is a test assignment for the development and integration of a Vehicle Telemetry System using Unity. The goal is to create a visually cohesive scene with a base road and a functioning vehicle while customizing the Vehicle Physics Pro package to suit one of the supplied vehicle models. Additionally, we will implement parameter extraction, real-time Heads-Up Display (HUD), and ensure that the extracted vehicle parameters are accessible throughout the codebase.
